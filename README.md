# Plasma-Bank-Application
In these unprecedented Covid-19 times, where the covid cases have been increasing, a high demand in plasma is seen to cure the covid patients with the plasma/antibodies of the already recovered patients. This application acts as a source of information for the seekers, donors, hospitals and Plasma banks to connect with each other for plasma.

“Plasma Bank Application” – a system where plasma seekers can find relevant plasma donors, connect with them privately. Also, seekers can connect with Hospitals and make a request. Willing and eligible Donors can register themselves with the application so that seekers can find them. Hospitals can register themselves with the various details of plasma blood group and their available unit details. Also, there can be different plasma banks having their own plasma reserves, registering with the application. All of these is stored in the database of the application and available to all users. 

This is a JAVA based console application.
